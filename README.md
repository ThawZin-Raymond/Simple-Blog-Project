# Simple-Blog-Project

Hi, I'm Thaw Zin! This blog is a showcase of my journey through web development, inspired and guided by "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.

Built from the ground up using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, this blog is a straightforward yet fully functional project, serving as an excellent practice ground for my developing skills.
